                    This trail is considered one of the most scenic trails in New England. 
                    Several waterfalls and a roughly 1.5 mile ridgeline walk create some of the best scenery in the White Mountains.
                    Additionally, the Greenleaf Appalachian Mountain Club hut is located on the descent of Old Bridle path, 
                    where hikers can refill water and buy snacks. The Appalachian Trail intersects this trail, so depending on the time 
                    of year, you may encounter some thru-hikers.

                    This trail is a moderate hike up Mt. Moosilauke. Although the stats seem tough, the trail is not bad for the White Mountains
                    and is suitable for beginners. The summit of Mt. Moosilauke is a bit strange for the area; the summit is covered in alpine grasses instead of rocks.
                    These grasses are very fragile, and many signs along the way remind hikers to stay on trail. This trail also intersects the Appalachian Trail.

                    A moderate trail to the summit of Mount Osceola in Wateville Valley. The summit of Osceola is known for its spectacular view
                    east/south-east. This is one of the best hikes to do for a sunrise since the trail is not that long and the view eastward is amazing.
